# YelpCamp Website - Web Developer Bootcamp Project
*Instructor: Colt Steele*

## Overview

YelpCamp is a web application project that I developed during a web developer bootcamp taught by Colt Steele. The project aimed to teach various web development technologies and concepts through hands-on experience in building a campground review website.

## Project Description

YelpCamp allows users to browse, review, and discuss various campgrounds. Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the website to access personalized features. Each campground listing includes essential details such as name, location, description, and images. Users can read and write reviews for campgrounds, provide a rating and a text description for their experiences. Additionally, users can leave comments on campground reviews to engage in discussions.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: The YelpCamp project includes user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out. This feature is essential for enabling personalized experiences and ensuring data security.

2. **Campground Listings**: The application displays a list of campgrounds, each with details such as name, location, description, and images. Users can browse through the campground listings to discover various locations.

3. **Campground Reviews**: Users can leave reviews for campgrounds they have visited. Each review includes a rating and a text description. Reviews provide valuable insights to help other users make informed decisions about their camping destinations.

4. **Rating and Reviews Count**: Each campground shows an overall rating based on user reviews, along with the total number of reviews received.

5. **Campground Images**: Users can upload images for each campground they review. The application uses Cloudinary for image storage and retrieval, enhancing the visual experience for users.

6. **Comments on Reviews**: Users can leave comments on campground reviews to participate in conversations.

7. **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile page displaying their username, information, and the reviews they contributed.

## Technologies Used

The YelpCamp project was developed using a variety of technologies, including:

- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates).

- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js (Web application framework for Node.js).

- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL database).

- **Authentication**: Passport.js (User authentication middleware).
  
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary(for image storage).
